# Learning how to learn page

Learning how to learn single page project.

## Description

A small one page project I made as part of my attendance of the Practicum100 by Yandex program. This is a single page website about the psychology of learning.

## Technologies used

The technologies used on the website was HTML and CSS only. Flexbox was used to position the elements and iframes to input the youtube video players on the page.
I used the BEM methodology to structure the file system and HTML classes.
